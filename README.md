# Wendell Furog

**`Web Developer | Electronics Engineering Graduate`**

Hi! I am Wendell Furog, a graduate of Bachelor of Science in Electronics Engineering at MSU-IIT and I am currently located here in Iligan City, Philippines. I’ve started learning how to code during the earlier days of my college years because it was required in our curriculum to take programming classes. I also did some self-learning during the pandemic to further improve my skills in the field. So, I initially planned to continue with my undergraduate degree and take the board exam and become a registered electronics engineer but it was during my internship at a startup solutions company where I started to become more interested in programming. Within the company, I have started to work with other people within the same field and I have discovered more about the software and web development industry. I’m also a fan of technology and computers that is why it was actually easy for me choose a different path instead of becoming electronics engineer and try making a career out of my programming and problem-solving skills.
